To send an email from your newly created Ubuntu machine in VMware to your Gmail account, you need to set up an SMTP client on your Ubuntu machine. Here's a step-by-step guide:


Steps to Configure and Send Email
##################################

1. Update and Install Necessary Packages
Run the following commands to ensure your Ubuntu system is updated and required tools are installed:

In bash terminal
----------------
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install -y postfix mailutils


	- **Postfix**: A mail transfer agent (MTA) that sends and routes emails.
	- **Mailutils**: Provides the `mail` command for sending emails.


2. Configure Postfix
During installation, you'll be prompted to configure Postfix. If not, you can run the configuration command manually:

In bash terminal
----------------
	sudo dpkg-reconfigure postfix

	Choose the following options:
		1. **General type of mail configuration**: Select **Internet Site**.
		2. **System mail name**: Enter your Ubuntu hostname (e.g., `ubuntu.local`).
		3. Accept default settings for other prompts.

	Reason: Postfix acts as an intermediary to relay the email to Gmail's SMTP server.

3. Enable Sending Emails via Gmail SMTP
Gmail requires authentication, so you need to configure Postfix to relay emails through Gmail's SMTP server.

Edit the Postfix configuration file:

	In bash terminal
	----------------
		sudo nano /etc/postfix/main.cf


		Add the following lines at the end of the file:

		# plaintext
		relayhost = [smtp.gmail.com]:587
		smtp_use_tls = yes
		smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
		smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
		smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous

	Reason: These settings enable Postfix to relay emails via Gmail's secure SMTP server using authentication.


4. Configure Gmail Authentication
Create a file to store your Gmail credentials:

	In bash terminal
	----------------
		sudo nano /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd

	Add the following line, replacing `your_email@gmail.com` and `your_password` with your Gmail address and app password:

		# plaintext
		[smtp.gmail.com]:587 your_email@gmail.com:your_password

	Important: Gmail requires an **App Password** if you have 2FA enabled. Generate an app password from your Google account security settings.

5. Secure the Authentication File
Set appropriate permissions to ensure the file is secure:

	In bash Terminal
	----------------
		sudo chmod 600 /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
		sudo postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd

	Reason: Prevent unauthorized access to your credentials.


6. Restart Postfix
Restart the Postfix service to apply the changes:

	In bash Terminal
	----------------
	sudo systemctl restart postfix

7. Send a Test Email
Use the `mail` command to send an email:

	In bash Terminal
	----------------
		echo "Test email from Ubuntu VM" | mail -s "Test Email" your_email@gmail.com

8. Check Mail Logs
If the email does not arrive, check the logs for troubleshooting:

	In bash Terminal
	----------------
		sudo tail -f /var/log/mail.log

Why This Setup is Necessary
1. Postfix: Sends and relays emails from your Ubuntu system.
2. Gmail SMTP: Gmail acts as a relay server to ensure emails reach external recipients.
3. TLS and Authentication: Securely transmits your email and verifies your identity.
4. App Password: Enhances security while allowing external apps to access Gmail.
